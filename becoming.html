                    in the end. There’s power in allowing yourself to be known and heard, in owning your unique story,
                    in using your authentic voice. And there’s grace in being willing to know and hear others. This, for
                    me, is how we become.” —Michelle Obama

                    <br><br>In writing Becoming, a work of deep reflection and mesmerizing storytelling, Michelle Obama
                    shared her own extraordinary journey to help create space for others to tell their stories and to
                    give people the courage to discover the power of their own voice. With this journal, she now
                    provides you with the encouragement to find value in your own personal journey of becoming. Printed
                    on cream writing paper, with a grosgrain ribbon, foil-stamped cover, and removable half-jacket,
                    Becoming: A Guided Journal for Discovering Your Voice includes thought-provoking prompts designed to
                    help you reflect on your personal and family history; your goals, challenges, and dreams; what moves
                    you and brings you hope; and what future you imagine for yourself and your community. Writes Mrs.
                    Obama in the Introduction to the Becoming journal, “I hope you’ll use this journal to write down
                    your experiences, thoughts, and feelings, in all their imperfections, and without judgment. . . . We
                    don’t have to remember everything. But everything we remember has value.”
