                <div class="book-status borrowed">Born to survivalists in the mountains of Idaho, Tara Westover was
                    seventeen the first time she set foot in a classroom. Her family was so isolated from mainstream
                    society that there was no one to ensure the children received an education, and no one to intervene
                    when one of Tara’s older brothers became violent. When another brother got himself into college,
                    Tara decided to try a new kind of life. Her quest for knowledge transformed her, taking her over
                    oceans and across continents, to Harvard and to Cambridge University. Only then would she wonder if
                    she’d traveled too far, if there was still a way home.
